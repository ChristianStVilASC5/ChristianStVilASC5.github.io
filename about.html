     <h3 class="titles"><strong>About me</strong></h3>
     <p class="text">My name is Christian St. Vil, and I am from Westchester, New York. I currently attend 
                 Ossining High School, graduating in 2020. After graduation, I would like to attend 
                 college, studying computer science. I would like to study computer science because
                 throughout high school I have had a passion for engineering and coding. My goals with 
                 computer science after college would be to pursue something in the computer science industry
                  and work for…  
     </p>
     <p class="text"> I would plan to achieve this with my hard work ethic and striving for the …
         For example, at the end of my sophomore year in high school when I had a computer 
         science final due that counted towards a majority of my grade,while I had other classes 
         to study for as well that were just as important. After I studied and completed all the work 
         for my other classes finals, I prepared to complete my computer science project which meant 
         staying up late in one night to complete an essay, and a 2-3 minute video. Through my work 
         ethic, I was able to complete all the criteria for the computer science project, along with
          the other finals, and receive great end of the year grades.
